Then you take 1 Contamination card and reshuffle everything (the just-drawn Contamination card, all nonInfected Contamination cards that you scanned and all Action cards, but except cards left in your hand) to create a new Action deck and you pass. The difference between this and Surgery is that in Surgery you need to discard all cards from your hand and reshuffle them with all the other ones to create a new deck + you don’t draw additional Contamination card from Contamination cards pile.
